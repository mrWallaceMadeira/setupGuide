# Day 0: Set up guide
Let me start by recognizing that this isn't going to be fun.\
All of these tools can be a pain to set up and occasionally lead to confusion.\
Put aside your brilliant, inquisitive student minds and follow the instructions, ***one-by-one***.\
This will all become clear soon enough, I promise.

This will walk through the three tools we'll be using
1. GitHub
2. git
3. IntelliJ
